When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld and saw several isolated small dots. Based on its rounded outline and black color, I determined that this was a stomata. Later, some scattered particles were found attached to the right edge of the weld. I judged this to be a splatter based on its irregular shape and metallic sheen. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
