When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, linear shape, I judged this to be an undercut. Then his eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and he saw several small metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered and protruding appearance, they were determined to be spatter. Looking down at the root area of ​​the weld, we found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on the low-lying and incomplete state of that area, it was judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, several small circular holes were noticed on the right side of the weld. Based on their smooth edges and isolated distribution, they were confirmed to be pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
