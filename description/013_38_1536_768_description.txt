When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several small metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular distribution and convex state, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling in the closing arc area was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying and flat outline, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, several small circular holes were noticed near the heat-affected zone. Based on their smooth inner walls and isolated distribution, I judged them to be pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
