When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld and moved my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld toward the end. When I focused on the weld toe area, I noticed a depression formed by localized metal erosion. Based on its continuous groove-like shape and location at the edge of the weld, I judged this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I noticed multiple irregular raised particles on the surface. Based on its randomly spaced, metallic globular appearance, I determined this to be splatter. Then in the arc closing area of ​​the weld, I found that the weld bead was uneven and wide and narrow. Based on its obvious surface undulations and irregular contours, I judged that this was a defective molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
