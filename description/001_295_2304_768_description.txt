When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and found several metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on their scattered distribution and irregular shape, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe towards the end, I saw that the root area was obviously collapsed and underfilled. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was not fully welded. Looking at the overall weld surface, it is undulating and rough in shape. Based on its irregular ripples and uneven width, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, on the right side of the middle of the weld, I noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld meat. Based on its color depth and inclusion shape, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
