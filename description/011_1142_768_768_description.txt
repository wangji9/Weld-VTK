When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld and found that the surface was uneven. Based on its irregular contours, I judged it to be poorly formed. Later, some scattered small particles were seen attached in the area around the weld. I judged this to be a splatter based on its metallic splattered appearance. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
