When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area of ​​the weld, we found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of irregular metal dots, this should be spatter. Later, at the closing section of the weld, we saw that the weld bead was uneven and had an uneven contour. Based on its rough and uneven appearance, we determined it to be poorly formed. Finally, near the heat-affected zone, dark blocks were noticed embedded in the weld. Combined with the morphology of the dark inclusions, it was confirmed that they were slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
