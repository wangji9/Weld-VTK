When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed small particles of metal attached here and there. Based on its irregular shape and randomly distributed location, I determined this to be a splatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
