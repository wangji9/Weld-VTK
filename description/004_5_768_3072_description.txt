When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several small protruding particles on the surface. Based on the appearance of metal spatter, I judged that this was spatter. Later, near the arc closing position, I found that the weld profile was obviously irregular. Based on its undulating shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
