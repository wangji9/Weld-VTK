When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan to the right to the end of the weld bead, I found that the weld profile was irregular. Based on its undulating shape, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld. Based on its irregular dark shape, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
