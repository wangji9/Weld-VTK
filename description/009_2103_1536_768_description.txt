When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment state, this should be spatter. Continuing to look at the tail of the weld, we noticed that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, we judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, in the overall forming area, we can see that the weld bead is uneven. According to its undulating appearance, it is considered to be poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
