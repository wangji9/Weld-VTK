When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered particles adhering to the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan down to the arc closing area, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed that the corrugations were disordered and uneven along the entire weld. Based on its irregular surface morphology, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
