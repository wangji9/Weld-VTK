When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the area around the fusion line, I noticed small particles attached here and there. I judged this to be a splatter based on its irregular shape and metallic sheen. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
