When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed grainy metal residue. Based on its scattered shape, I judged this to be a splash. Continue to scan towards the end, and find that the weld surface is uneven in the arc closing area. Based on its irregular contours, I judged it to be poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
