When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the right to the middle of the weld, I found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal balls, I judged that this was spatter. Then, uneven and irregular contours were seen in the upper area of ​​the weld. Based on its rough and undulating appearance, it was determined to be poor molding. Finally, near the closing arc, dark spots were noticed embedded in the weld bead. Combined with their irregular block-like characteristics, it was determined to be slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
