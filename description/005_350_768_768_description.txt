When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found some metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on the sporadic bright spot characteristics, I judged that this was splashing. Continuing to observe towards the end of the weld, I saw that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its uneven contour, I judged that this was a poor molding. Finally, I noticed a dark block embedded in the weld in the heat-affected zone on the lower side. Based on its irregular dark shape, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
