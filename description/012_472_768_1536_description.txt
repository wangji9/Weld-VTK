When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edge of the upper surface, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous shape and distribution along the fusion line, I judge that this is an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached near the weld. Based on their scattered distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the arc closing area, the surface of the weld is uneven and the outline is irregular. Based on its overall undulating shape, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, I saw some dark spots embedded in the weld near the root of the weld. Based on their dark color and blurred boundaries, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
