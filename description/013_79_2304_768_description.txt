When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned toward the middle and found several metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe towards the end, the weld seam is uneven overall. Based on its obvious undulating contour, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, near the arc closing area, I saw a dark block embedded in the weld bead. Based on its dark color and irregular shape, I judged that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
