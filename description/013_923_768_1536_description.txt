When examining this image, I initially focused on the edge of the weld, moving my eyes primarily along the toe line of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, sharp outline, I judged this to be an undercut. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
