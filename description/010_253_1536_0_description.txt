When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned toward the middle and found a lot of granular foreign matter attached to the surface. Based on its metallic luster and random distribution, I determined it to be splash. Continuing to look towards the tail, we can see an obvious depression in the arc closing area. Based on the low-lying characteristics of its outline, it is judged that the welding is not full. Finally, we noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld meat on the left side of the middle part of the weld. Combined with its irregular shape and dark color, it was confirmed that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
