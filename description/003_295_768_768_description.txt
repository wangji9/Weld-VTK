When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned toward the middle and found small metal dots scattered on the surface. Based on their random distribution and metallic luster, I judged that these were splashes. Continuing to look at the overall outline of the weld, I noticed that the reinforcement was uneven and the width was different. Due to the obvious fluctuations in its shape, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, I saw several dark spots embedded in the weld bead in the lower area. Based on their dark color and blurred boundaries, I judged that these were slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
