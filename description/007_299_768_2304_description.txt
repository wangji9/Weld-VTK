When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. Based on their dark and lumpy color, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking towards the end, I found that the root was obviously sunken. Based on the depth of the partial collapse, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed some scattered small metal dots around the weld toe. Based on their randomly distributed shape, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
