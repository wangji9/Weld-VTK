When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead, which was dark in color. Based on its irregular and massive characteristics, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the welding seams were of varying widths and had obvious undulations. Based on the uneven contours, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I noticed scattered small metal dots attached in the arc closing area. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
