When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the end area of ​​the weld and saw metal particles attached to the surface. Based on its scattered bright spot characteristics, I judged this to be a splash. Later, it was found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the root of the weld. I judged this to be under-welded based on its recessed and under-filled outline. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
