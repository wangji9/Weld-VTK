When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld and moved my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld toward the end. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed a continuous depressed groove with an edge that was significantly lower than the base metal surface. Based on its elongated shape along the fusion line, I judged this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and found that the surface was uneven, wide and narrow, and the outline looked messy. Based on its irregular shape and obviously undulating weld beads, I judged that this was a poor molding. Later, many small metal particles were seen attached on both sides of the weld, with uneven sizes and scattered distribution. Based on its punctate and non-fused features, I determined this to be spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
