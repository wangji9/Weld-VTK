When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, linear shape, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several small metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered and convex appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Later, in the end area of ​​the weld, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying and incomplete characteristics, I judged that this was incomplete welding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
