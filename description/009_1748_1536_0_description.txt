When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and found a lot of granular foreign matter attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal balls, I judged that it was splash. Continuing to look down, in the end area of ​​the weld, we can see that the filling is obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judge that this is incomplete welding. Finally, near the root, I noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld. Based on its irregular dark spot characteristics, I judged that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
