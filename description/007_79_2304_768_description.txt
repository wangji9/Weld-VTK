When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a lot of granular foreign matter attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal dots, I judged that this was spatter. Continue to scan to the right to find the ending section of the weld, and find that the weld bead is uneven. Based on its irregular contour, I judged that this is a poor molding. Finally, near the heat-affected zone, I noticed a dark block embedded in the weld. Based on its uneven color and inclusion shape, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
