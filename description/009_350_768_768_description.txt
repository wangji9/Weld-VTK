When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end of the weld, the weld bead is uneven. Based on its uneven contour, I judge that it is poorly formed. Finally, I saw dark foreign matter embedded in the fusion line near the root of the weld. Based on its irregular dark block-like features, I judged that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
