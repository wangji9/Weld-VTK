When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their random distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was splash. Continuing to look towards the end of the weld, I saw an obvious collapse in the arc closing area. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was not fully welded. Then I paid attention to the overall weld bead shape and found that the corrugations were disordered and uneven. Based on this irregular shape, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, at the lower middle part of the weld, I saw several dark spots embedded in the weld meat. Based on their dark blocky features, I judged that this was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
