When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the middle part of the weld, I noticed the residue of granular foreign matter. Based on its dark color and embedded near the fusion line, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continue to scan towards the end of the weld and find that the surface is uneven. Based on the irregular outline and stiff transition, I judged that this was a poor molding. Later, scattered small metal dots were seen attached to the edge of the heat-affected zone. Based on the shape of bright silver beads and scattered distribution, I judged that this was a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
