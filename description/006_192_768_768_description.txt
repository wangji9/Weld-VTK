When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a lot of metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their randomly distributed point-like characteristics, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the closing arc position. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Looking at the overall weld bead direction, some areas are uneven. Based on its irregular shape, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, I noticed a dark foreign object embedded near the root of the weld. Based on its dark blocky appearance, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
