When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the lower weld toe area and saw some scattered small particles attached. I judged this to be splatter based on its metallic sheen and random appearance. Then at the end of the weld where the arc ends, I found that there was a significant lack of fill. Based on the deep dents and rough surface, I judge that it is not fully welded. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
