When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several small dot-shaped holes. Based on their circular outline and distribution characteristics, I judged that these were pores. Then I noticed some scattered small particles attached near the edge of the weld. Based on their irregular convex shape, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
