When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned the middle part and found many metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe towards the end, I saw that the root area was obviously collapsed. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed that the entire weld was of varying widths and undulations. Based on its irregular shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
