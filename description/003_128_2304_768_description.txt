When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld bead, which were obviously dark in color. Based on their irregular block shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Then I noticed some scattered small metal points attached to the surface on the lower edge of the weld. Based on their raised and chaotically distributed features, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
