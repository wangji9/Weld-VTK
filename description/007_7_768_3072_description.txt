When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered small metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end, I found that the filling in the arc closing area was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed that the corrugations were disordered and uneven along the entire welding seam. Based on its overall uneven appearance, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
