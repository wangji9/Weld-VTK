When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned the middle part and found many metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look to the right at the end of the weld, I noticed a clear lack of filler metal, which I judged to be underfill based on its low-lying outline. Finally, I observed in the overall forming area that the weld seam was uneven and varied in width. Based on its irregular shape, I judged that this was poor forming. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
