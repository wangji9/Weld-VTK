When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed small particles of metal adhering to the surface. Based on its scattered distribution and irregular shape, I judged this to be a splatter. Continuing to look towards the end of the weld, we found that the contour of the weld bead was irregular. Based on its obviously undulating shape, I judged it to be poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
