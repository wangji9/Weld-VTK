When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area, I found scattered metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was splashing. Then I noticed at the end of the weld that the overall contour was not smooth enough. Based on its uneven shape, I judged it to be poorly formed. Finally, I saw a foreign object embedded inside near the closing arc. Based on its dark blocky features, I judged it to be slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
