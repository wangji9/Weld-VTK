When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the middle part of the weld, I noticed the residue of granular foreign matter. Based on the fact that it is dark in color and embedded near the fusion line, I judge that this is a slag inclusion. His eyes continued to sweep towards the arc closing area, and he found that the surface was uneven. Based on the irregular outline and stiff transition, I judged that this was a poor molding. Looking further towards the edge, we can see some small metal dots attached to the base material. Based on the fact that it is scattered and clearly higher than the surface, I judge that this is a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
