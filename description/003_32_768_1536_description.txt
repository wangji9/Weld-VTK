When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered small bumps on the surface. Based on its metallic granular appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan to the right, I found that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its undulating and irregular contour, I judged that this was a poor molding. Finally, I noticed several small round pits in the arc closing area. Based on their round shape and smooth inner wall, I judged that these were pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
