When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered distribution and convex shape, I judged that this was spatter. Looking down at the end area of ​​the weld, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its concave and under-filled characteristics, I judged that this was incomplete welding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
