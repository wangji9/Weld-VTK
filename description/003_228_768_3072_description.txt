When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed a noticeable dent. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld surface and saw some scattered small particles attached. I judged this to be a splatter based on its metal splattered appearance. Later, near the end of the weld, it was discovered that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its irregular contours, I judged it to be poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
