When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, it was found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of irregular metal dots, it was determined to be spatter. Later, it was noticed that the entire weld was of varying widths, and based on its uneven contour, it was judged to be poorly formed. Finally, dark patches embedded inside the weld were seen at the arc closing position. Combined with its irregular block shape and dark color appearance, it was confirmed that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
