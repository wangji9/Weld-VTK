When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several small dot-like black spots. Based on their circular outline and distribution position, I judged that these were pores. Later, at the arc closing point on the right side of the weld, I found some scattered particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular shape and attachment state, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
