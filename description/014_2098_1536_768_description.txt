When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found sporadic metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Then near the end of the weld, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I observed the overall appearance of the weld and found that it was unevenly undulating. Based on its irregular wave-like trend, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
