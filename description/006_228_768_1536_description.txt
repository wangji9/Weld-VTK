When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the end area of ​​the weld and saw metal particles attached to the surface. I judged this to be splatter based on its scattered, grainy appearance. Subsequently, a significant lack of filler metal was found at the root of the weld. Based on its dented and underfilled appearance, I judged that it was under-welded. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
