When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several small protruding particles on the surface. Based on their metallic luster and random distribution, I judged them to be spatter. Then I continued to scan to the end of the weld and found that the overall contour was irregular. Based on its obvious undulations, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
