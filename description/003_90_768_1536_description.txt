When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment state, this should be spatter. Continuing to look towards the tail of the weld, the overall contour is obviously uneven. Based on its abrupt and undulating shape, it is determined to be poor molding. Finally, dark spots were noticed embedded in the weld bead in the lower heat-affected zone. Combined with its dark blocky features, it was determined to be slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
