When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered small bumps on the surface. Based on its metallic granular appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look down, I found insufficient filling in the root area of ​​the weld. Based on its obviously collapsed contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I also noticed several small round pits on the surface of the weld. Based on their round shape and smooth inner wall, I judged that these were pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
