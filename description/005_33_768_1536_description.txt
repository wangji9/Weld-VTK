When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed a noticeable dent. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld and saw scattered metal particles attached to the surface. Based on its irregular dot distribution, I judged this to be splatter. Later, it was found that the weld profile was irregular near the closing arc position. Based on its undulating shape, I judged it to be poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
