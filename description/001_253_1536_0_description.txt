When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, linear shape, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular block shape and dark color characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient at the arc closing position, and a piece of the surface was concave. Based on its low-lying and unfilled appearance, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed some scattered small metal dots attached to the base material in the spatter area, with irregular shapes and protruding from the surface. Based on their random distribution and convex state, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
