When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead. Based on its dark blocky features, this should be slag inclusion. Looking further to the right, the surface of the weld is uneven and the outline is crooked. The rough and uneven appearance clearly indicates poor molding. Finally, many small metal points were found scattered around in the arc closing area. According to the characteristics of this sporadic distribution of bright spots, they are splashes. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
