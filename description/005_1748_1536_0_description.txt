When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and found a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered distribution, I judged that they were splashes. Continuing to look down, in the root area of ​​the weld, I can see that the filling is obviously insufficient. Based on the concave contour, I judge that it is not fully welded. Finally, near the closing arc, I noticed that there were dark foreign objects inside. Based on its irregular blocky features, I judged that it was slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
