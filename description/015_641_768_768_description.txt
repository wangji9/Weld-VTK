When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned the middle part and found many metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe the end area of ​​the weld to the right, I can see that the filler metal is obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judge that this is under-welding. Finally, I noticed that the overall weld bead was uneven in height and width. Based on its irregular shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
