When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed a noticeable dent. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld and saw sporadic particles attached to the surface. I judged this to be splatter based on its small metallic globular appearance. A significant lack of filling was then discovered near the end of the weld. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged it to be under-welded. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
