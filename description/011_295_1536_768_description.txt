When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found many metal particles attached. Based on their randomly distributed point-like characteristics, I judged that this was a splash. Continuing to move toward the end of the weld, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Then I paid attention to the overall direction of the weld bead and found that the ripples were disordered and uneven. Based on its abrupt and undulating appearance, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, near the closing arc area, I noticed dark foreign matter embedded in the weld meat. Based on its irregular block shape and dark color appearance, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
