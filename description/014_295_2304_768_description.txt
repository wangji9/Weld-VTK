When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was splashing. Continuing to look towards the end of the weld, I saw an insufficiently filled pit in the arc closing area. Based on its local low-lying shape, I judged that this was an incomplete weld. Pay attention to the overall contour. The weld bead is uneven. Based on its uneven shape, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, a dark foreign object was vaguely visible inside the weld. Based on its irregular dark block-like features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
