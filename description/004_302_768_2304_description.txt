When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my eyes mainly along the edge of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld and found that some areas were obviously low-lying. Based on its underfilled outline, I judged this to be under-welded. Several sporadic attachments of small particles were subsequently noticed around the weld. I judged this to be a splatter based on its metallic splattered appearance. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
