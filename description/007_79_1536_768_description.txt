When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of irregular metal dots, I judged that this was spatter. Then I saw the weld bead was uneven at the end of the weld. Based on its uneven contour, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, a dark patch was noticed near the heat-affected zone. Based on the dark block-like features embedded inside the weld, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
