When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular block shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking towards the end, I found that there was obviously insufficient metal at the root. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I also noticed some scattered small metal points on the surface of the weld. Based on their random distribution and raised state, I judged that these were spatters. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
