When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and found that the deposited metal had not filled the groove. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that it was not fully welded. Looking to the right, there are several small dots scattered on the surface. Based on the characteristics of circular holes, I judge that these are pores. At the same time, sporadic particles were also seen attached around the weld. Based on its irregular raised state, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
