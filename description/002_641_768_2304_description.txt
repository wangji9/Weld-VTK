When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found scattered particles scattered on the surface, which I judged to be spatter based on their metallic spherical appearance. Then near the end of the weld, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I observed the overall appearance of the weld and found that it was uneven and varied in width. Based on its irregular contour trend, I judged that it was poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
