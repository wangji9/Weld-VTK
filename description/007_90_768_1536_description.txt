When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area, I found a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Then I noticed an irregular and uneven contour at the end of the weld. Based on its overall undulating appearance, I judged that this was a poor molding. Finally, I saw dark spots embedded in the weld bead near the heat affected zone. Based on its irregular block shape and dark color features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
