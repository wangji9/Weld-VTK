When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed small particles of metal adhering to the surface. Based on its scattered distribution and irregular shape, I judged this to be a splatter. Continuing to look towards the end of the weld, we found that the weld bead was uneven. Based on the obvious undulations in its outline, I judged that this was a poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
