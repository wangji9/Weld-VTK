When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the solder toe area, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found a lot of small particles attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of metal splashing, I judged that it was spatter. Continuing to look at the tail of the weld, I noticed that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I saw several small circular holes near the closing arc. Based on their regular hole shapes, I judged that they were air holes. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
