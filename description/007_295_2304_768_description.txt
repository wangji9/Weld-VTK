When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment state, this should be spatter. Continuing to look down, we can see an obvious depression and lack of flesh in the arc closing area. Based on the low-lying characteristics of its outline, it is determined that it is not fully welded. Pay attention to the overall weld bead shape. The trend is skewed and uneven, combined with its abrupt undulations, which indicates poor molding. Finally, a dark foreign object was seen embedded near the root of the weld. Based on its massive dark appearance, it was determined to be slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
