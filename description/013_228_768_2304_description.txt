When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered particles scattered on the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look to the right, I found insufficient filling in the arc closing area. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed unevenness along the entire welding seam. Based on its irregular corrugated shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
