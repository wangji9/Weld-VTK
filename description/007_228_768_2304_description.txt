When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment state, I judged that this was spatter. Then near the end of the weld, I saw a low-lying area that was obviously underfilled. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was under-welded. Finally, I observed the overall appearance of the weld and found that the corrugations were disordered and uneven. Based on its irregular contour trend, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
