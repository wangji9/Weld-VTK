When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the root of the weld, I noticed a lack of metal buildup. Based on the shape of its depression, I judged that it was not fully welded. Then my eyes moved to near the surface of the weld, and I saw some scattered small particles attached. Based on their distribution and appearance, I judged this to be splatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
