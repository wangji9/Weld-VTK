When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw many small particles attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of metal splashing, I judged that this was spatter. Continue to scan to the right to find the end area of ​​the weld bead, and find that the weld bead is uneven. Based on its irregular contour, I judged that this is a poor molding. Finally, near the bottom, I noticed a dark foreign object embedded in the weld. Based on its irregular block shape and dark characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
