When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the left area of ​​the upper surface, I noticed a dent in the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was splashing. Continuing to look at the weld outline to the right, I saw that the overall shape was uneven. Based on its obvious undulations, I judged it to be poorly formed. Finally, I noticed a dark patch near the closing arc position. Based on the dark features embedded in the weld, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
