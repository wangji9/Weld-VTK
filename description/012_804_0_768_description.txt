When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld surface, and several metal particles were seen attached. Based on its scattered bright spots, I judged this to be a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
