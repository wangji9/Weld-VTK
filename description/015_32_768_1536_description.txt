When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed a noticeable dent. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end of the weld, I found that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its obvious undulating contour, I judged that this was a poor molding. Finally, I noticed several small round holes near the closing arc. Based on their round shape and smooth inner wall, I judged that these were pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
