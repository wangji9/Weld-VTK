When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found several small granular protrusions scattered on the surface. Based on its metallic luster and random distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Then in the end area of ​​the weld, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low and flat outline, I judged that this was incomplete welding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
