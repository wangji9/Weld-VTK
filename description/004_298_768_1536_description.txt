When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my eyes mainly along the edge of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and found that the local area was significantly lower than the base metal on both sides. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged it to be under-welded. Later, several scattered small particles were seen attached to the surface of the weld. I judged this to be a splatter based on its metallic spherical appearance. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
