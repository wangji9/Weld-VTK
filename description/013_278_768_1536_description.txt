When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some scattered small particles attached to the surface. Based on their metallic luster and irregular distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the closing arc position. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed dark spots embedded in the weld bead in the root area of ​​the weld. Based on its dark blocky features, I judged that this was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
