When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw uneven metal accumulation. Based on its undulating outline, I judged that this was poor molding. Moving forward to the closing arc area, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on the depth of the depression, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, in the intensive spatter area, I saw many small particles attached. Based on the randomly distributed metal dot-like characteristics, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
