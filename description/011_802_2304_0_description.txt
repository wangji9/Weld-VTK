When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, linear shape, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found several metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered and convex appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end, I saw obvious underfilling in the arc closing area. Based on its concave and incomplete characteristics, I judged that this was incomplete welding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
