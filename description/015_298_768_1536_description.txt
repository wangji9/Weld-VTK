When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my eyes mainly along the edge of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous shape and distribution along the weld toe, I judge that this is an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and found that the local area was significantly lower than the base metal on both sides. Based on the depth of the dent and the lack of full contour, I judged that it was not fully welded. Then I saw sporadic granular attachments in many places on the surface of the weld. Based on their random distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
