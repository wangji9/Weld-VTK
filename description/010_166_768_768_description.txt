When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some scattered small particles attached to the surface. Based on their metallic luster and irregular distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continue to scan to the right to find the end of the weld, and find that the weld bead is uneven and has an irregular contour. Based on its rough and undulating appearance, I judged that this is a poor molding. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed several dark spots embedded in the weld. Based on their dark blocky features, I judged that this was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
