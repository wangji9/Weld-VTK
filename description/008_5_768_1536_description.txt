When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several small dot-like black spots. Based on their circular outline and distribution position, I judged that these were pores. Then I found some scattered small particles attached to the right edge of the weld. Based on their irregular convex shape, I determined that they were spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
