When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld bead. Based on their dark color and irregular shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking further towards the end, the surface was littered with small metal dots, which I assumed were splatters based on their raised and randomly distributed appearance. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
