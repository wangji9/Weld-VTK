When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld and moved my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld toward the end. When focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an obvious concave groove with clear edges and a darker color. Based on its continuous linear shape and positional characteristics, I judge that this is an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld and found several irregular dark spots embedded in the surface of the weld bead, with different sizes and scattered distribution. Based on its granular appearance and gray-black color, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, we can see that the filler metal is obviously insufficient at the closing arc position, forming a locally depressed pit-like area. Based on its low-lying shape and underfilled appearance, I judged this to be underwelded. Finally, multiple small metal particles were noticed in the heat-affected zone around the weld, which were silvery white and obviously convex. Based on its random scattering and metallic sheen, I judge this to be a splatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
