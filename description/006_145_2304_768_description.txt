When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan down to the closing arc position, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Looking to the right, I looked at the overall trend of the weld and found that it was uneven. Based on its distorted shape, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I noticed dark spots embedded in the weld meat near the root. Based on its irregular dark block-like features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
