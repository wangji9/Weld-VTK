When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area of ​​the weld, I found scattered particles scattered on the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Then we saw an insufficiently filled low-lying area at the closing arc position. Since it was significantly lower than the contour of the base metal, we determined that it was not fully welded. Finally, the unevenness and width of the entire weld were noticed. Combined with its irregular shape, it was determined to be poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
