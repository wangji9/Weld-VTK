When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead. Based on its irregular dark block-like features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient at the arc closing position. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed sporadic small metal dots attached around the weld. Based on the appearance of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
