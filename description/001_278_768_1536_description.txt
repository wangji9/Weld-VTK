When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead, which was dark in color. Based on its irregular block characteristics, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient in the arc closing area and the surface was low. Based on the concave outline, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed a lot of small metal dots scattered around in the splash zone. Based on their randomly distributed raised state, I judged that this was a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
