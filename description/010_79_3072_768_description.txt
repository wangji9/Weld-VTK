When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and found several metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on their scattered distribution and irregular shape, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end of the weld to the right, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged that it was not fully welded. Paying attention to the overall weld bead shape, I found that the surface was undulating and varied in width. Based on this rough appearance, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, near the arc closing area, I noticed some dark spots embedded in the weld. Based on their dark blocky features, I judged that there was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
