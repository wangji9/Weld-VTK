When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some scattered small particles attached to the surface. Based on their metallic luster and irregular distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan to the right to the end of the weld, I found that the weld bead was uneven and had an irregular contour. Based on its rough and undulating appearance, I thought it was poorly formed. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed several dark spots embedded in the weld. Combined with their dark blocky features, I judged them to be slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
