When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Then in the upper area of ​​the weld, I saw several small circular holes. Based on their smooth edges and isolated distribution, I judged that these were pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
