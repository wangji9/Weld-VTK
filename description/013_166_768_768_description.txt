When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of irregular metal dots, I judged that this was spatter. Then I noticed an irregular contour at the end of the weld. Based on its undulating shape, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I saw dark spots embedded in the weld bead near the heat affected zone. Based on its dark blocky appearance, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
