When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. Based on its dark, lumpy color, I judged it to be slag inclusions. Looking further towards the end, we see that the filler metal is significantly lower than the base metal surface. Based on the depth of the dent, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally noticed some scattered small metal dots around the solder toe. Based on its irregular distribution pattern, I judged this to be a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
