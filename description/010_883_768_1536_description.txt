When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed small particles of metal adhering to the surface. Based on its chaotic distribution and point-like sputtering shape, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end of the weld, we found that the weld bead was uneven and the contour was irregular. Based on its overall undulating appearance, I judged that it was poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
