When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular adhesion, I judged that this was spatter. Continue to scan to the right to find the end of the weld bead, and find that the weld is uneven. Based on its obvious undulating contour, I judged that this is a poor molding. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed a dark foreign object embedded in the weld. Based on its dark blocky characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
