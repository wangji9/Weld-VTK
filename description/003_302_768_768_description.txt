When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. Based on their dark and lumpy color, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the closing arc position. Based on the depth of the depression and unevenness, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed many small metal dots attached to the surface in the spatter-intensive area. Based on their randomly scattered patterns, I judged that these were spatters. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
