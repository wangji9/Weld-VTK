When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When focusing on the surface of the weld, I noticed some small metal particles attached. Based on its chaotic distribution and point-like raised features, I judged that this was a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
