When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan down to the closing arc position, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Looking to the right to see the overall trend of the weld, we found that the corrugations were disordered and uneven. Based on its irregular surface topography, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I noticed a dark foreign object embedded in the weld meat near the root. Based on its dark blocky appearance, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
