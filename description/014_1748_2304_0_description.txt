When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular and massive characteristics, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking towards the end, I found that there was obviously insufficient metal in the root area. Based on its concave and unfilled outline, I judged that this was under-welded. Finally, I also noticed some scattered small metal dots around the weld. Based on their random distribution and raised appearance, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
