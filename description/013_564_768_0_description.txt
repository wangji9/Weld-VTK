When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the central area, I found sporadic metal particles attached. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was splashing. Then I saw an uneven surface near the root of the weld. Based on its rough and uneven contours, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I noticed a dark patch embedded in the weld bead near the closing arc. Based on its dark blocky characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
