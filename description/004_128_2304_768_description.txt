When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld bead, which were obviously dark in color. Based on their irregular block shape and dark color characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Then I noticed some scattered small metal points attached to the surface on the lower edge of the weld. The shape was round but abrupt. Based on the appearance of isolated bulges, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
