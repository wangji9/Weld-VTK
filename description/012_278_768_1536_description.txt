When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the root area of ​​the weld, and I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Then I saw scattered small particles adhering to many places on the surface of the weld. Based on its irregular raised appearance, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
