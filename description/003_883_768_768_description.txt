When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed small particles of metal adhering to the surface. Based on its chaotic distribution and point-like raised features, I judged that this was a splash. Continuing to look towards the end of the weld, we found that the contour of the weld bead was irregular. Based on its distorted and uneven appearance, I judged that it was poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
