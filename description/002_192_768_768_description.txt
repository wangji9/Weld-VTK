When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the left area of ​​the upper surface, I noticed a dent in the edge. Based on its linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the right, I saw some small particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered distribution, I judged that this was a splash. Then I found insufficient filling in the middle of the weld. Based on the degree of depression, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Looking towards the end, the weld contour is irregular. Based on its distorted shape, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, I noticed dark spots near the roots, which I judged to be slag inclusions based on their embedded characteristics. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
