When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found sporadic metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end of the weld to the right, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed the uneven weld bead in the overall formed area, and based on its uneven appearance, I determined that it was poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
