When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular block shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient at the arc closing position and the surface was low. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, in the spatter intensive area, I noticed many small metal points attached to the base material and distributed randomly. Based on their random scattering characteristics, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
