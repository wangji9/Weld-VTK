When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper surface near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. I judged this to be an undercut based on its continuous, sharp-edged shape. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some scattered small particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular shape and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end of the weld, I found an uneven surface in the reinforcement transition zone. Based on its rough and uneven appearance, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, I noticed a dark spot embedded in the weld near the weld toe. Based on its dark color and lumpy features, I judged it to be slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
