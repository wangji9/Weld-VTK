When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the area near the weld toe, I noticed some grainy buildup. Based on its chaotic distribution and convex surface characteristics, I judged that this was a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
