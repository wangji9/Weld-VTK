When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found a lot of granular foreign matter attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal dots, I judged that it was splash. Continuing to look at the tail of the weld, I noticed that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, near the heat-affected zone, I saw dark lumps inside. Based on its irregular dark shape, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
