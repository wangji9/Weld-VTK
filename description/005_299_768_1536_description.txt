When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular block shape and dark color characteristics, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking down at the end area of ​​the weld, we can see that the filling is obviously insufficient and the surface is low. Based on the degree of depression and the lack of full contour, I judge that this is incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed some scattered small metal dots around the weld, which were randomly distributed. Based on their rounded and convex shape, I judged that these were spatters. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
