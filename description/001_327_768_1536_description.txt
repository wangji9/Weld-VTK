When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld bead, which were obviously dark in color. Based on their irregular and massive features, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Then I noticed some scattered small metal dots attached to the surface on the lower edge of the weld, which were in the shape of beads. Based on their protruding and chaotic distribution, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
