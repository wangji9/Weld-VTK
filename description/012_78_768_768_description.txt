When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the end of the weld, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the arc closing position. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I scanned the weld surface as a whole and found that the ripples were disordered and uneven. Based on its rough appearance, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
