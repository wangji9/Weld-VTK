When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld surface, and I noticed some scattered small particles attached. I judged this to be splatter based on its metallic sheen and irregular distribution. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
