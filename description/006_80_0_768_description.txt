When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the middle part of the weld, I noticed the residue of granular foreign matter. Based on its dark color and characteristics of being embedded in the molten pool, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continue to scan to the right to the weld toe area and find that the surface is uneven. Based on its irregular contours and abrupt transitions, I judged this to be poor molding. Looking towards the end, we can see scattered small metal dots attached to the base material. Based on its spherical and scattered shape, I judged this to be a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
