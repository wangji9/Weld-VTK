When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several small round pits on the surface. Based on their circular outline and black dot-like appearance, I judged that these were pores. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling in the arc closing area was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed some scattered particles adhering to the periphery of the weld. Based on their small metal spherical shape, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
