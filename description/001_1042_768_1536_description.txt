When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When focusing on the surface of the weld, I noticed many small metal particles attached to the weld and the heat affected zone. Based on its irregular spherical shape and silver-gray metallic luster, I judged this to be a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
