When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was splashing. Continuing to look at the end, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged that it was not fully welded. Looking at the overall outline, the weld bead is uneven. Based on its uneven shape, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, in the root area of ​​the weld, I noticed that dark foreign matter was embedded. Based on its irregular dark block-like features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
