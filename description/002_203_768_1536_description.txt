When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area of ​​the weld, I found a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. Then at the closing arc position, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, along the entire weld bead direction, I noticed that the corrugations were disordered and uneven. Based on its overall irregular shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
