When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the right to the middle of the weld, I found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal balls, I judged that this was spatter. Then I saw the weld bead was uneven in the upper area of ​​the weld. Based on its irregular contour, I thought it was poorly formed. Finally, I noticed dark spots embedded in the weld near the closing arc. Based on its irregular block shape and dark color features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
