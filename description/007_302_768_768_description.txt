When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld meat, which was dark in color. Based on its irregular and massive features, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient at the arc closing position and the surface was low. Based on the degree of depression, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, in the spatter area, I noticed many small metal dots attached to the base material with abrupt shapes. Based on their random distribution and convex state, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
