When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found a lot of metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered distribution, I judged that this was splashing. Continuing to observe towards the tail, I saw a clear lack of filling in the closing arc area. Based on the concave contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed several dark spots inside the weld bead. Based on their irregular blocky features, I judged that these were slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
