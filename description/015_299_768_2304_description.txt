When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, sharp outline, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I found several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular block shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to look to the right, I saw that the filling in the arc closing area was obviously insufficient and the surface was low. Based on the depth and contour of the depression, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, in the spatter area, I noticed some small metal dots scattered around the weld, with round and protruding shapes. Based on their random distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
