When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment, I judged that this was spatter. Later, at the arc closing point at the end of the weld, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I scanned the appearance of the weld as a whole and noticed that the ripples were disordered and uneven. Based on its irregular surface trend, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
