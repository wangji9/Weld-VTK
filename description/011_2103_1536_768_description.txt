When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, sharp outline, I judged this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld and found several metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on its random distribution and raised morphology, I judged this to be a splatter. Then in the closing arc area, it was seen that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying, under-filled characteristics, I judged this to be under-welded. Finally, scanning the overall weld profile, we found that the shape was irregular and undulating. Based on its twisted and uneven shape, I judged it to be poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
