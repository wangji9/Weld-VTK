When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found sporadic metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Later, uneven contours and undulations were seen in the weld reinforcement transition zone. Based on its rough and uneven appearance, it was determined to be poor molding. Finally, several small circular holes were noticed near the arc closing position. Combined with their smooth edges, they were determined to be pores. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
