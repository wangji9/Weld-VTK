When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the left area of ​​the upper surface, I noticed a dent in the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found that the surface was uneven. Based on its irregular contours, I judged it to be poorly formed. Looking further to the right, I noticed several small dot-like cavities. Based on its round shape and smooth inner wall, I judged this to be a stomata. Finally some particles are seen attached near the weld toe. Based on the way the metal particles were piled up, I judged it to be spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
