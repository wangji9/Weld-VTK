When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the middle part of the weld, I noticed the residue of granular foreign matter. Based on its dark color and characteristics of being embedded in the molten pool, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continue to scan towards the end of the weld and find that the surface is uneven. Based on its irregular outline and obvious undulations, I judged that this was a poor molding. Subsequently, sporadic small metal dots were seen attached near the heat-affected zone. Based on its scattered, unfused form, I judged this to be spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
