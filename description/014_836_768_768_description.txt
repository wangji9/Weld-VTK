When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the surface of the weld, I noticed small metal particles scattered here and there. Based on its chaotic distribution and dot-like raised shape, I judged that this was a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
