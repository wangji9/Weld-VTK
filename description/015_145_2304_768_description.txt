When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found many metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on their scattered distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look towards the tail of the weld, I saw a clear lack of filling in the closing arc area. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Paying attention to the overall weld bead shape, I found that the surface was uneven and varied in width. Based on this irregular appearance, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, I noticed several dark spots embedded in the weld meat on the side near the groove. Based on their dull color and irregular block shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
