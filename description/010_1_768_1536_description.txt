When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a few scattered small particles attached. Based on its metallic sheen and irregular distribution, I judged this to be splatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
