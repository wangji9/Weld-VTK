When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on their scattered distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look towards the tail of the weld, I saw a clear lack of filling in the arc closing area. Based on its low and uneven contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Paying attention to the overall weld bead shape, I found that the weld bead was of varying widths and undulating heights. Based on this irregular shape, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, I noticed dark spots embedded in the weld meat on the side near the groove. Based on its dark blocky features, I judged that there was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
