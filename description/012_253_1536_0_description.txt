When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and saw some scattered small particles on the surface of the weld. Based on its metallic luster and adhesion state, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe towards the tail, I found that the root area was insufficiently filled. Based on its significantly lower profile than the base metal, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed irregular dark spots inside the weld near the edge. Based on their chaotic distribution and dark features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
