When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When focusing on the middle part of the weld, I noticed small particles of metal residue attached to the surface. Based on its chaotic distribution and bright color, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end of the weld, I found that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its irregular shape, I judged that this was a poor molding. Then, near the arc closing area, I saw a dark foreign object embedded in the weld. Based on its dull color and unfused edges, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
