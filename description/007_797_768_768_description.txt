When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the root area of ​​the weld and found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying outline, I judged this to be under-welded. Subsequently, scattered particles were seen attached in many places on the surface of the weld. With its irregular metallic dot appearance, I judged this to be a splatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
