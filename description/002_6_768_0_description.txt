When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the end area of ​​the weld and saw scattered particles attached to the surface. I judged this to be splatter based on its small metallic globular appearance. Later, it was found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the root of the weld. I judge this to be under-soldered due to its dented and under-filled features. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
