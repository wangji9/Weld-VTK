When examining this image, I initially focused on the beginning of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead toward the end. When focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an obvious concave groove with jagged edges and a darker color. Based on its continuity, depth, and location, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I found several metal particles attached to the surface, with different sizes and scattered distribution. They looked like the residue of molten droplets splashed during welding. Based on their shape and attachment state, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I saw that the filler metal was obviously insufficient at the arc closing position, forming a low-lying gap. The surface was rough and not flush with the base metal. Based on its outline and height difference, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed a dark foreign object embedded inside the weld, with irregular shape and blurred boundaries. Based on its color and embedded characteristics, I judged that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
