When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld meat, which was dark in color. Based on its irregular and massive characteristics, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking further towards the end, I found that there was obviously a lack of metal in the root area. Based on its sunken and underfilled appearance, I judged that this was under-welded. Finally, I also noticed sporadic small metal points attached around the weld. Based on their randomly distributed round granular shape, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
