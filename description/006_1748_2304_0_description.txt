When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area of ​​the weld, it was found that there were granular metal residues attached to the surface. According to its irregular point distribution characteristics, this should be spatter. Later, at the arc closing point at the end of the weld, it was seen that the filler metal was obviously insufficient. According to its low-lying contour, it was judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, a dark foreign object was detected close to the heat-affected zone embedded in the weld bead. Based on its dark blocky appearance, it was confirmed to be slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
