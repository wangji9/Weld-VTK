When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld and moved my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld toward the end. When I focused on the weld toe area, I noticed a depression formed by localized metal erosion. Based on its continuous groove-like shape and location at the edge of the weld, I judged this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found granular metal residue attached to the surface. Based on its irregular distribution and silver-gray appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Then at the arc closing point of the weld, I saw that the filler metal was significantly lower than the surface of the base metal. Based on the depth of the depression and the unfilled contour, I judged that this was under-welded. Moving forward, I noticed that the entire weld was uneven in width and undulating. Based on its wavy shape and irregular transition, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, somewhere inside the weld, I observed a dark lump embedded in the weld bead. Based on its irregular shape and color that was obviously different from the surrounding metal, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
