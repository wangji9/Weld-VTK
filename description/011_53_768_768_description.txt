When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a lot of metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their sporadic attachment, I judged that this was spatter. Later, near the arc closing position, I found that the welding seam contour was irregular. Based on its undulating shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
