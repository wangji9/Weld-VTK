When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed small particles of metal adhering to the surface. Based on its chaotic distribution and point-like sputtering shape, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look towards the end of the weld, we found that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its irregular outline and obvious undulations, I judged that it was poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
