When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the end area of ​​the weld, and I saw small metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered appearance, I thought they were spatter. Later, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the root of the weld. Based on its low and uneven outline, I judged that it was not fully welded. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
