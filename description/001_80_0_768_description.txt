When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the middle of the weld, I noticed a grainy residue. Based on the fact that it is dark in color and embedded near the fusion line, I judge that this is a slag inclusion. Then I looked at the arc closing area and found that the surface was uneven. Based on the irregular outline and stiff transition, I judged that this was a poor molding. Glancing to the side again, I saw a few small metal particles adhering to the edge of the weld. Based on its dot shape and scattered distribution, I judged that this was a splash. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
