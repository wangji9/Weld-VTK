When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed a noticeable dent. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found scattered metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Then I noticed an underfilled low-lying area at the end of the weld. Based on its obvious depression depth, I judged that this was under-welded. Finally, I saw that the weld bead was uneven in the overall forming area. Based on its uneven contour, I judged that this was poor forming. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
