When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Then near the root of the weld, I saw that the weld bead was uneven. Based on its irregular contour, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, in the internal area of ​​the weld, I noticed that dark foreign matter was embedded. Based on its uneven color and blocky features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
