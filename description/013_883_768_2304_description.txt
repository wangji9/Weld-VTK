When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, I found sporadic metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Then, near the arc closing position, I saw an irregular weld contour. Based on its undulating shape, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
