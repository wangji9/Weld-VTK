When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe the root area of ​​the weld to the right, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed that the weld bead was uneven at the arc closing position. Based on its rough surface undulations, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
