When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the weld toe area, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan to the middle of the weld, it was found that there were granular foreign objects attached to the surface. Based on the characteristics of irregular metal dots, it was determined to be spatter. Later, it was noticed that the overall contour of the weld was not smooth enough, and based on its uneven shape, it was judged to be poorly formed. Finally, a dark block was seen embedded in the fusion line near the root of the weld. Based on the appearance of dark inclusions, it was confirmed to be slag inclusions. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
