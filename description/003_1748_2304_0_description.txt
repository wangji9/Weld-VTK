When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I glanced toward the middle and found a lot of granular foreign matter attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal balls, I judged that it was splash. Continuing to look down at the root area of ​​the weld, I noticed that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its sunken and unfilled appearance, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I saw a dark lump embedded in the weld meat in the lower middle part of the weld. Based on its irregular dark inclusion characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
