When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their random distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was splash. Continuing to look towards the tail of the weld, I saw an obvious collapse in the arc closing area. Based on the depth of the depression and the incomplete contour, I judged that this was an incomplete weld. Paying attention to the overall outline, I found that the weld bead was undulating. Based on its wavy shape, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I noticed dark spots embedded in the weld near the root. Based on its irregular block shape and dark color features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
