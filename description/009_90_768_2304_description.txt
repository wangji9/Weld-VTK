When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned toward the middle and found several metal particles attached to the surface of the weld. Based on their irregular point distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to look at the arc closing area, the outline of the weld is obviously irregular. Based on its undulating shape, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, near the root, I saw some dark foreign matter embedded in the weld. Based on its dark, lumpy features, I judged that it was slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
