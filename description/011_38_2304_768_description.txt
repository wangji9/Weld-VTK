When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, linear shape, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several small pits on the surface. Based on their round and scattered appearance, I judged that these were pores. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling in the arc closing area was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying and incomplete appearance, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed some sporadic particles adhering to the periphery of the weld. Based on the characteristics of small metal dots, I judged them to be spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
