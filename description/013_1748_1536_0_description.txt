When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I moved my eyes to the lower weld toe area and saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld seam, which were obviously dark in color. Based on their irregular block shape and dark color characteristics, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking towards the end of the weld, I found that the local filling was obviously insufficient and the surface was low. Based on the fact that its outline was not full, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, I also noticed some scattered small metal dots around the weld, which were scattered in a chaotic manner. Based on their raised and isolated appearance, I judged that these were spatters. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
