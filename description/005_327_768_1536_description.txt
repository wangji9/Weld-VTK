When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld bead. Based on its irregular dark block-like features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Then I noticed some scattered small metal dots on the lower edge of the weld. Based on their raised and chaotic appearance, I judged that these were spatters. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
