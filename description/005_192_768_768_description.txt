When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead. Based on its dark blocky features, this should be slag inclusion. Looking towards the end, the weld metal obviously does not fill the groove. According to its low and uneven contour, it is not fully welded. At the same time, the overall weld bead has undulating heights and different widths. Based on this rough and uneven appearance, it is judged to be poor molding. In addition, there are many small metal spots scattered around the weld. The scattered bright spots are spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
