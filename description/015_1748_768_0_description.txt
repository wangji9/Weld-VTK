When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found a lot of granular foreign matter attached to the surface. Based on its metallic luster and random distribution, I judged that this was a splash. Continuing to observe towards the tail, I saw an obvious depression and lack of flesh in the arc closing area. Based on the unfull outline, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld bead in the lower middle part of the weld. Based on its irregular shape and dark appearance, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
