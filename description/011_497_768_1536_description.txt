When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw a few scattered small particles attached. I judged these to be splatters based on the metallic, irregular appearance of them. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
