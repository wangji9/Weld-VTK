When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the left area of ​​the upper surface, I noticed a dent in the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I looked toward the middle and found that the metal was unevenly stacked. Based on its undulating outline, I judged that this was poor molding. Scanning to the right, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on the depth of the depression, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed some scattered particles around the weld. Based on their point distribution and metallic luster, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
