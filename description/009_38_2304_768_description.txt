When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the root area of ​​the weld, and I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Then I noticed several small dots in the middle of the weld, and based on their appearance as round black dots, I determined that these were blowholes. Finally, I saw some scattered particles on the surface of the weld. Based on their irregular raised state, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
