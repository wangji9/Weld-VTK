When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous and sharp edge shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then the eyes moved to the middle of the weld and saw the uneven surface and irregular outline. Based on its overall undulating state, I judged that this was poor molding. Subsequently, several small circular holes were found in the area on the right side of the weld. Based on its rounded edges and isolated distribution, I judged this to be a stomata. Finally some scattered particles were noticed adhering around the weld. I judged this to be splatter based on its metallic dot-like appearance. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
