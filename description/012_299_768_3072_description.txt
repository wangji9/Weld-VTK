When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the tail area of ​​the weld, and I saw sporadic particles attached to the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Later, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient at the root of the weld. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
