When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, sharp outline, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several metal particles attached to the surface. Based on their scattered and protruding shape, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filling in the arc closing area was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying and unfull appearance, I judged that it was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed that the weld bead was uneven in the overall forming area. Based on its twisted and irregular trend, I judged that it was poorly formed. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
