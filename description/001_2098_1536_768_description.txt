When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Continuing to scan the middle area of ​​the weld, I found scattered particles scattered on the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Then at the closing arc at the end of the weld, I saw that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its low-lying contour, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I observed the direction of the weld as a whole and found that the ripples were disordered and uneven. Based on its irregular surface morphology, I judged that this was poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
