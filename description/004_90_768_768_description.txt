When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed obvious dent marks. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some irregular particles attached to the surface. Based on the appearance of small metal dots, I judged that this was spatter. Continue to scan to the right to find the end of the weld, and find that the weld bead is uneven. Based on its uneven contour, I judged that this is poor molding. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld. Based on the characteristics of the dark inclusions, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
