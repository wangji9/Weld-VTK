When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached. Based on the characteristics of scattered bright spots, I judged that this was splashing. Continuing to look at the arc closing area, the weld profile is obviously irregular. Based on its undulating shape, I judge that this is a poor molding. Finally, near the heat-affected zone, I saw a dark block embedded in the weld bead. Based on its irregular dark shape, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
