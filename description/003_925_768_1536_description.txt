When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the solder toe area, I noticed a dent on the edge. Based on its shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the surface of the weld, and I saw some small particles attached. Based on its distribution, I judged this to be splatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
