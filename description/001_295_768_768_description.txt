When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, linear shape, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld bead, which were obviously dark in color. Based on their irregular block shape and dark color characteristics, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Continuing to scan to the right to find the arc closing position, I found that the surface of the weld was uneven and the outline was skewed. Based on its overall uneven appearance, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, I noticed some small metal dots scattered around the weld in the spatter zone. Based on their sporadic distribution and raised state, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
