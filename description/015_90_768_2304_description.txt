When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the left area of ​​the upper surface, I noticed a dent in the edge. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found several metal particles attached. Based on their scattered distribution and appearance of bright spots, I judged them to be splashes. Continuing to look at the overall outline of the weld to the right, I noticed that the ripples were disordered and uneven. Based on this rough and uneven surface condition, I thought it was poor molding. Finally, close to the arc closing position, dark foreign matter was seen embedded inside. Combined with its irregular block-like characteristics, it was determined to be slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
