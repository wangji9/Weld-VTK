When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw scattered particles scattered on the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found insufficient filling at the closing arc position. Based on its obviously collapsed contour, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed unevenness in the overall forming area. Based on its undulating and irregular surface, I judged that this was poor forming. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
