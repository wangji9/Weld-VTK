When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle area of ​​the weld, and I saw some scattered small particles attached to the surface. Based on their metallic luster and irregular distribution, I judged that this was spatter. Continue to scan to the right to find the end of the weld, and find that the weld bead is uneven and has an irregular contour. Based on this rough appearance, I think it is poorly formed. Finally, near the heat-affected zone on the lower side, I noticed a dark lump embedded in the weld. Combining its dark color and inclusion-like features, I judged it to be a slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
