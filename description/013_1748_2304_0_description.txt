When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. Focusing on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed an elongated depression. Based on its continuous, sharp outline, I judged this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw several granular foreign objects embedded in the weld meat. The color was obviously dark. Based on its irregular block shape, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found that the filler metal was obviously insufficient in the arc closing area and the surface collapsed. Based on its low-lying shape, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed sporadic small spots attached around the weld, which were round and protruding in shape. Based on their metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
