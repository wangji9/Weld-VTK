When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a small dent on the edge. Based on its continuous linear shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then I scanned towards the middle and found scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment state, this should be spatter. Continuing to look down, there is obviously a lack of meat in the arc closing area. Based on its concave outline, it is judged that it is not fully welded. Pay attention to the overall contour. The welds are uneven. This rough appearance indicates poor molding. Finally, a dark foreign object was seen embedded at the root. Based on its dark blocky characteristics, it was confirmed to be slag inclusion. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
