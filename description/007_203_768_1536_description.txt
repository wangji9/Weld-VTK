When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. When I focused on the left side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered small particles attached to the surface. Based on its metallic spherical appearance, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to observe the root area of ​​the weld to the right, I found that the filling was obviously insufficient. Based on its concave and unfilled characteristics, I judged that this was incomplete welding. Finally, I noticed an irregular weld contour at the arc closing position. Based on its uneven shape, I judged that this was a poor molding. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
