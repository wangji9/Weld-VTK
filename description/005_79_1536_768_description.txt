When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead. Based on its dark and irregular appearance, I judged that this was slag inclusion. Looking further to the right, the surface of the weld is uneven. Based on its uneven contour, I judge that this is poor molding. Finally, I found sporadic small dots attached in the arc closing area. Based on the reflective characteristics of the metal particles, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
