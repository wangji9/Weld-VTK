When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld bead. When I focused on the upper side near the fusion line, I noticed a clear depression. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw scattered metal particles scattered on the surface. Based on their irregular attachment, I judged that this was spatter. Continuing to scan towards the end, I found a low-lying area that was insufficiently filled in the arc closing area. Based on the fact that it was significantly lower than the contour of the base metal, I judged that this was not fully welded. Finally, I noticed that the weld bead was uneven in height and width in the overall forming area. Based on its uneven appearance, I judged that this was poor forming. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
