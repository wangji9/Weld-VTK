When examining this image, I initially focused on the start of the weld, moving my gaze primarily along the centerline of the weld. Focusing on the edges of the upper surface, I noticed a noticeable indentation. Based on its continuous groove-like shape, I judge this to be an undercut. Then my eyes moved to the middle of the weld, and I saw some granular foreign matter embedded in the weld bead. Based on its irregular dark blocky features, I judged that this was a slag inclusion. Moving forward to the arc closing area, I found that the weld seam was uneven. Based on its uneven contours, I judged that this was poor molding. Finally, in the spatter intensive area, I noticed small metal dots scattered around the weld. Based on the characteristics of randomly distributed bright spots, I judged that this was spatter. The weld was ultimately judged to be unqualified.
